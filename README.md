# Send emails through Outlook with Python
The main goal of this python code is to automate the process of sending emails to employees that have tickets open for more than 3 days.  
This task has been performed with excel VBA but python can do the exact same thing in 3 minutes. 
In the past it would take me about 3 hours per week to send out the remainder emails to everyone on the team.
